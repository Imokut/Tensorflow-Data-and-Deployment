In this lesson you'll take that to the next level, recognizing real images of Cats and Dogs in order to classify an incoming image as one or the other. In particular the handwriting recognition made your life a little easier by having all the images be the same size and shape, and they were all monochrome color. Real-world images aren't like that -- they're in different shapes, aspect ratios etc, and they're usually in color!\n\nSo, as part of the task you need to process your data -- not least resizing it to be uniform in shape. \n\nYou'll follow these steps:\n\n1.

It's making a guess as to the classification of the training data, and then measuring it against the known label, calculating the result. Accuracy is the portion of correct guesses. The Validation accuracy is the measurement with the data that has not been used in training. As expected this would be a bit lower. You'll learn about why this occurs in the section on overfitting later in this course.","metadata":{"id":"mu3Jdwkjwax4"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"history = model.fit(train_generator,\n                              validation_data=validation_generator,\n                              steps_per_epoch=100,\n                              epochs=15,\n                              validation_steps=50,\n                              verbose=2)","metadata":{"id":"Fb1_lgobv81m","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-02T05:44:07.363784Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-04-02T05:44:07.365044Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-02T05:53:58.342248Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-04-02T05:44:07.364997Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-04-02T05:53:58.340705Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Evaluating Accuracy and Loss for the Model\n\nLet's plot the training/validation accuracy and loss as collected during training:","metadata":{"id":"Q5Vulban4ZrD"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#-----------------------------------------------------------\n# Retrieve a list of list results on training and test data\n# sets for each training epoch\n#-----------------------------------------------------------\nacc      = history.history[     'accuracy' ]\nval_acc  = history.history[ 'val_accuracy' ]\nloss     = history.history[    'loss' ]\nval_loss = history.history['val_loss' ]\n\nepochs   = range(len(acc)) # Get number of epochs\n\n#------------------------------------------------\n# Plot training and validation accuracy per epoch\n#------------------------------------------------\nplt.plot  ( epochs,     acc, label='Training')\nplt.plot  ( epochs, val_acc, label='Validation')\nplt.title ('Training and validation accuracy')\nplt.legend()\nplt.figure()\n\n#------------------------------------------------\n# Plot training and validation loss per epoch\n#------------------------------------------------\nplt.plot  ( epochs,     loss, label='Training')\nplt.plot  ( epochs, val_loss, label='Validation')\nplt.legend()\nplt.title ('Training and validation loss')","metadata":{"id":"0oj0gTIy4k60","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-02T05:53:58.347435Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-04-02T05:53:58.347827Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-02T05:53:58.906217Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-04-02T05:53:58.347792Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-04-02T05:53:58.904704Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As you can see, we are **overfitting** like it's getting out of fashion. Our training accuracy (in blue) gets close to 100% (!) while our validation accuracy (in orange) stalls as 70%. Our validation loss reaches its minimum after only five epochs.\n\nSince we have a relatively small number of training examples (2000), overfitting should be our number one concern. Overfitting happens when a model exposed to too few examples learns patterns that do not generalize to new data, i.e. when the model starts using irrelevant features for making predictions. For instance, if you, as a human, only see three images of people who are lumberjacks, and three images of people who are sailors, and among them the only person wearing a cap is a lumberjack, you might start thinking that wearing a cap is a sign of being a lumberjack as opposed to a sailor. You would then make a pretty lousy lumberjack/sailor classifier.\n\nOverfitting is the central problem in machine learning: given that we are fitting the parameters of our model to a given dataset, how can we make sure that the representations learned by the model will be applicable to data never seen before? How do we avoid learning things that are specific to the training data?\n\nIn the next exercise, we'll look at ways to prevent overfitting in the cat vs. dog classification model.","metadata":{"id":"DgmSjUST4qoS"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Save the Model\n\nIn the cell below, save the trained model as a Keras model (`.h5` file).\n\n**HINT**: Use `model.save()`.
